# This README, intended for the grading staff, is meant to provid some clarity around the shell script files included within this directory.

1. All shell scripts in relation to the dealers reqiure a "0000_Dealer_schedule.txt" file to work (with proper syntax of the date number).

2. The "Roulette_Dealer_Append_Script.sh" was used in Step 3 -> Dealer Analyis -> Sub-Step 3, to gather needed evidence into the required file. I figured this would not only save me time but also prepare me for the following steps.

3. The "Roulette_Dealer_Echo_Script.sh" script name was used instead of the requested name "roulette_dealer_finder_by_time.sh" as mentioned in Step 4 -> Sub-Step 1. I chose a different name for file consistancy/clarity on my end.

4. The "All_Games_Dealer_Echo_Script.sh" script name was used instead of the requested name "roulette_dealer_finder_by_time_and_game.sh" as mentioned in the Optional Challenge step.


Additionally, you may notice the above scripts have extra commands or features not required, but more to bring greater ease of use for those running the scripts. I did this to learn futher and ideally emulate how I would create a script like this in the professional setting.

All work is original, and was very fun to figure out!
